## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 8+
- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Command Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and deploy everything with Docker
git clone <repository-url>
cd musicr
./deploy.sh
```

That's it! The application will be running at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:4000/health

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment documentation.

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment files
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

### Running the project

```bash
# Start both API and web in development mode
pnpm dev

# Or start them separately:
pnpm --filter @musicr/api dev    # API on http://localhost:3001
pnpm --filter @musicr/web dev    # Web on http://localhost:3000
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm --filter @musicr/api build
pnpm --filter @musicr/web build
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Lint all packages
pnpm lint

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean
```

## Environment Variables

### API (`apps/api/.env`)

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
HOST=localhost
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # Optional
```

## üéµ How Mapping Works

Musicr transforms your everyday messages into relevant songs using a sophisticated AI-powered mapping system. Here's how it works:

### The Process

1. **Text Analysis** - Your message is analyzed for emotional context, keywords, and intent
2. **Strategy Selection** - The system chooses the best matching strategy (exact phrase, semantic similarity, or mood mapping)
3. **Song Retrieval** - Relevant songs are found from our curated database
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Each match is scored based on relevance and context
5. **Result Selection** - The highest confidence match is returned, with alternatives for close calls

### Mapping Strategies

#### 1. **Exact Match** (Highest Confidence)
Direct phrase matches from song lyrics or titles:

```
"hey jude" ‚Üí "Hey Jude" by The Beatles
"bohemian rhapsody" ‚Üí "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen  
"shake it off" ‚Üí "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift
```

#### 2. **Semantic Similarity** (Medium-High Confidence)
AI understands context and emotional meaning:

```
"running late, train delayed" ‚Üí "Waiting on the World to Change" by John Mayer
"I got promoted!" ‚Üí "Good Life" by OneRepublic
"feeling lonely tonight" ‚Üí "Somebody That I Used to Know" by Gotye
"stuck in traffic jam" ‚Üí "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey
```

#### 3. **Mood Mapping** (Medium Confidence)
Emotional context drives song selection:

```
"celebrating my birthday" ‚Üí "Dancing Queen" by ABBA
"she broke up with me" ‚Üí "Rolling in the Deep" by Adele
"perfect sunny day" ‚Üí "Happy" by Pharrell Williams
"stressed about work" ‚Üí "Stressed Out" by Twenty One Pilots
```

### Real Examples

#### Simple Cases
```
Input: "just got engaged!"
‚Üí Song: "Dancing Queen" by ABBA
‚Üí Strategy: mood (celebration)
‚Üí Confidence: 87%
```

#### Complex Cases with Tie-Breaking
```
Input: "We need to talk"
‚Üí Primary: "Since U Been Gone" by Kelly Clarkson (confidence: 76%)
‚Üí Alternative: "Irreplaceable" by Beyonc√© (confidence: 74%)

Why "Since U Been Gone" won:
‚Ä¢ Higher semantic similarity to relationship confrontation
‚Ä¢ More direct lyrical connection to difficult conversations
‚Ä¢ Stronger association with relationship endings in our training data
```

#### Context-Aware Mapping
```
Input: "california dreaming again"
‚Üí Song: "Hotel California" by Eagles
‚Üí Strategy: semantic + geographic
‚Üí Confidence: 92%

The system recognized:
‚Ä¢ Geographic reference (California)
‚Ä¢ Nostalgic emotional tone ("dreaming")
‚Ä¢ Cultural association with classic rock
```

#### Ambiguous Input Resolution
```
Input: "love song"
‚Üí Primary: "I Want It That Way" by Backstreet Boys (confidence: 45%)
‚Üí Alternatives: 12 other love songs

Low confidence indicates multiple valid matches:
‚Ä¢ "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran (confidence: 44%)
‚Ä¢ "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran (confidence: 43%)
‚Ä¢ "All of Me" by John Legend (confidence: 42%)
```

### Confidence Scoring

- **90-100%**: Exact phrase match or unmistakable context
- **75-89%**: Strong semantic similarity, clear intent
- **60-74%**: Good contextual match, some ambiguity
- **45-59%**: Multiple valid interpretations
- **Below 45%**: Fallback to popular/generic songs

### Edge Cases & Limitations

#### What Works Well
‚úÖ Emotional expressions: "feeling happy", "so sad"  
‚úÖ Life events: "got married", "new job"  
‚úÖ Weather/mood: "sunny day", "rainy mood"  
‚úÖ Direct song references: "hey jude", "bohemian"  

#### Challenging Cases
‚ö†Ô∏è Abstract concepts: "quantum physics breakthrough"  
‚ö†Ô∏è Very specific scenarios: "left my keys in the car"  
‚ö†Ô∏è Cultural references: "like Shakespeare said"  
‚ö†Ô∏è Technical language: "API endpoint returning 404"  

#### Fallback Behavior
When confidence is very low, the system falls back to:
1. Popular songs from relevant genres
2. Mood-appropriate selections
3. Generic crowd-pleasers like "Don't Stop Believin'"

### System Learning
The mapping system continuously improves through:
- **Usage patterns**: Popular mappings get reinforced
- **Context analysis**: Better understanding of phrase meanings  
- **Cultural updates**: New songs and trends incorporated
- **Feedback loops**: User interactions inform future mappings

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/map` - Map text to song (see mapping examples above)
- `GET /ws` - WebSocket connection for real-time chat

## WebSocket Events

### Client ‚Üí Server
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, how are you?"
}
```

### Server ‚Üí Client
```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "data": "‚ô™ How You Remind Me - Nickelback ‚ô™",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
