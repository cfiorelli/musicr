Use Beads for any task that is multi-step, spans multiple files, or may take more than ~30 minutes.
Before coding:
- create or update a bead for the task
- define acceptance criteria
During execution:
- update bead status as phases complete
- record blockers and decisions
At the end:
- mark done or note exact remaining work
Do not ask me to break work down if a reasonable breakdown can be created directly.
